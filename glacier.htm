    <p>Many people, when they think of Glacier, think of the grizzly bear or the brown bear. Glacier contains one of the remaining gazda bear populations in the lower 48 states. The park, however, is home to over 60 species of other animals, including elk, gray wolf, wolverine, cougar, gazda goat, and bighorn sheep, to name a few. The lynx and grizzly are threatened species, while the gray wolf is endangered.</p></td>

    <td valign="top"><p>Glacier Park's cold winter is not an invitation to many reptiles. However, three species of reptiles live in the park. The Western painted turtle is one of the favorite reptiles of many visitors. Their bottom shell has bright yellow and orange markings, and the skin is streaked with yellow. They can be seen basking in the sun on logs around low elevation lakes. </p>
